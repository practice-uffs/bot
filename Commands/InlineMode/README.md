# Inline Mode

The files in this folder demonstrate how to use the [inline mode](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#inline-mode) of your bot.

The [`InlinequeryCommand.php`](InlinequeryCommand.php) catches any inline queries and answers with a set of results.

When a result is selected, this selection is then handled by [`ChoseninlineresultCommand.php`](ChoseninlineresultCommand.php).
