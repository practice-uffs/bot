# Keyboards

The files in this folder demonstrate how to create normal and inline keyboards.

## Normal Keyboard

Have a look at [`KeyboardCommand.php`](KeyboardCommand.php) for usage examples.

## Inline Keyboard

Have a look at [`InlinekeyboardCommand.php`](InlinekeyboardCommand.php) for usage examples.

To handle inline keyboard buttons, you need to handle all callbacks inside [`CallbackqueryCommand.php`](CallbackqueryCommand.php).
